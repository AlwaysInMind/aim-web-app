# Always in Mind

This project is a flexible platform designed to improve the quality of life of people such as those in later stages of life who may be becoming isolated. Often, people at this stage of life are not technology users but could benefit from the social aspects of online digital activities. For example, they can share photos, videos, access interesting information resources or engage with others via messages and video calls, for example with remote family and friends. The design is also suitable for people with learning disabilities wanting to access online resources and activities.

Always in Mind is a web app providing simplified, friendly and safe access to the digital websites and communications services that we use daily. Services such as Google Photos, YouTube, GMail, Facebook are transformed and complexity removed. A friend can use these services to share photos and images and Always In Mind makes them easily accessible through a very simple user experience runing on an PC, tablet, or even a TV. There are levels of complexity to suit the users pereferences. Help is always available to provide a ready reminder.

# Open Source project and a self sustaining service

Support for people with cognitive disabilities lags far behind other users so innovation is critical and largely missing. So we are fully open source in order to share ideas and encourage open innovation through an active community of people interested in improving provision. Both the front end and back end code can be found here in this repositry

However, people want to be customers of a reliable and well supported service. So we need to develop a self sustaing product. This requires a crystal clear problem and solution that people will be will into to subscribe to. We are currently exploring ideas and are keen to collaborate in order to get this into the hands of people whom will benefit.

* YouTube - shows videos in playlists
* GMail - read latest email
* Google Tasks - tasklist used to provide a list of web pages to view (under review)
* Microsoft cognitive services picture description AI - creates descriptions of photos
* Auth0 - secure authorisation and access management

# Roadmap

We now have enough code to implement a technical prototype to put before users to find out what their needs and preferences really are. Thus the next steps is user research, We then want to get the live paid services working ASAP so people can start benefiting. Call it LEAN if you like :)

We have decided to bootstrap rather than seek funding as we think the constraints will force us to develop a more user focussed product

# Technical notes

It's a React powered SPA web app for maximum portability and we use a nodejs backend to abstract the various services and handle senstive operations.

# A "Shout out" to some of the great tools we use 

* Visual Studio Code - for the best dev experience
* Zeit now - for the best devops experience
* Auth0 - for the best identity management and authentication experience
* Web Standards - for the most portable solution
* Javascript - because...
* React
* nodejs
* Yarn
* webpack, ESLint, prettier and many other great tools and libs
