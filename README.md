# Always in Mind

A tool and service to improve the quality of life of people such as those in later stages of life who are not technology users but wish to share photos, videos, messages and calls with others, including remote family and friends.

We do this by providing easy access to media and communications services such as Google Phots, YouTube and Gmail. A friend can use these services to share photos and images. The end user then gets a very simple experience to access these media and comms. There are levels of complexity to suit the users pereferences and help for every thing.

# An Open source service

Users want a reliable and well supported service so we need to be self sustainable. Thus https://alwaysinmindinfo.org is a subscription service (or will be).

Support for people with cognitive disabilities lags far behind other users so innovation is critical and largely missing. In roder to share ideas and perhaps develop a community we are fully open source. Both the front end and back end can be found here in this repositry

# Roadmap

We now have enough code to implement a technical prototype to put before users to find out what their needs and preferences really are. Thus the next steps is user research, We then want to get the live paid services working ASAP so people can start benefiting. Call it LEAN if you like :)

We have decided to bootstrap rather than seek funding as we think the constraints will force us to develop a more user focussed product

# Technical notes

It's a React powered SPA web app for maximum portability and we use a nodejs backend to abstract the various services and handle senstive operations.

# A Shout to some of the great tools we use
