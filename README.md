# Always in Mind

A tool and service to improve the quality of life of people such as those in later stages of life who are not technology users but wish to share photos, videos, messages and calls with others, including remote family and friends.

We do this by providing easy access to media and communications services such as Google Phots, YouTube and Gmail. A friend can use these services to share photos and images. The end user then gets a very simple experience to access these media and comms. There are levels of complexity to suit the users pereferences and help for every thing.

# Technical notes

It's a React powered SPA web app for maximum portability and we use a nodejs backend to abstract the various services and handle senstive operations.
